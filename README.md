# SimRakeTests

Please uniquely name your test file and identify it as yours (netID can be used to do both).

Please specify the output expected for each test, either as comments, or in what the test itself outputs.

There's no fancy way to run all the tests in this repo at once, so you'll have to fiddle with each one yourselves :cry:
